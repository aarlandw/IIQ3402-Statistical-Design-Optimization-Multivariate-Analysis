# Tarea 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis

In this task we performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about if an individual could smell certain smells or not, if the individual had symptoms, and if their results on the PCR test were positive or negative. The dataset was provided in [CSV File](Enunciado_Tarea1/datos_tarea1.csv) format.

We performed simple data analysis to see the distribution of the data, the correlation between the variables, and the relationship between the variables. We also did not perform data cleaning on the data set. Which we probably could have done.

Information, findings, and analsysi can be found in our [report](Tarea_1_grupo_1.pdf)
